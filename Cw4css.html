    All students are hereby informed that maintaining discipline and cleanliness in the school premises is everyone’s responsibility. Every classroom should remain tidy, and littering in the corridors or playground is strictly prohibited.

Students are also reminded to respect school property, including benches, boards, and walls. Let’s work together to make our school a pleasant and inspiring place to learn.

Your cooperation and active participation in keeping our school clean and beautiful are highly appreciated.All students are hereby informed that maintaining discipline, cleanliness, and good behavior within the school premises is the duty and responsibility of every student. Our school is a place of learning, growth, and inspiration, and it is important that we all work together to preserve its beauty and harmony.

Every classroom should remain clean, organized, and well-maintained at all times. Please ensure that the floors, desks, and blackboards are kept tidy. Littering in classrooms, corridors, or the playground is strictly prohibited. Dustbins have been placed in every corridor — students are expected to use them responsibly.

Students are also reminded to respect and care for school property, including benches, desks, laboratory equipment, and walls. Scribbling, drawing, or damaging school furniture in any form is an act of indiscipline and will not be tolerated. Each one of us must take pride in keeping our surroundings neat and presentable.

Let us also remember that discipline is the foundation of success. Students should be punctual, well-behaved, and attentive during classes and assemblies. Proper uniform, respectful language, and good manners reflect the true spirit of our school community.

Together, let us make our school a model of cleanliness, order, and inspiration — a place where every student feels proud to belong. Your cooperation, awareness, and active participation in maintaining a clean and disciplined environment are highly appreciated and will help create a better learning atmosphere for everyone.

Let’s join hands to make our school shine — clean, green, and full of learning!</p>
